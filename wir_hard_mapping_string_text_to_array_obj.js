// Direction : Get array data from string below ("users" object) and make it object like "expected result"!! The conditions are :
// 1. Split data based on key (the key in brackets)
// 2. Each object of array in the "user" variable is separated by a comma ","
// 3. Make sure the data is sequential according to the user id
